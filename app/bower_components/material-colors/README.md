# Material Colors

Colors from [Google's Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html) made available to coders.

The colors are scraped from the guide. The idea to publish colors in multiple forms is stolen from [mrmrs/colors](https://github.com/mrmrs/colors).

## Available Forms

- CSS: Classes for prototyping such as `.color-red-100`, `.bg-red-100`, `.border-red-100`, `.fill-red-100` and `.stroke-red-100`.
- Sass, Scss: Color variables such as `$md-red-100`.
- Less: Color variables such as `@md-red-100`.
- Stylus: Color variables such as `md-red-100`.
- JSON: Raw data of colors.

See [dist directory](dist) for more detail.
